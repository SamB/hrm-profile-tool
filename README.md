# Human Resource Machine Profile Tool

This repository contains Go libraries to read, decode, and render
Human Resource Machine code from a `profiles.bin` file.

There is also a tool `hrm` that can render programs as text (which
is compatible with Human Resource Machine, i.e. it can be pasted
into the game) and as SVGs which mimic the style found in the game.
